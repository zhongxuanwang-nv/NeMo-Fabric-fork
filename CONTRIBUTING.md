# Contributing to NVIDIA NeMo Fabric

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NeMo Fabric. This guide covers
the development workflow, coding standards, and pull request process.

## Contribution Access

Anyone with a GitHub account may create or comment on an issue in this public
repository. Pull request creation is limited to approved users in the
`NeMo-Fabric-developers` group. General changes require CODEOWNER approval from
`NeMo-Fabric-reviewers`, a subset of the developer group. Documentation and
dependency changes use their specialized approver groups.

For non-security contributions, external contributors should open an issue with
a reproducer, proposed design, or patch description. A NeMo Fabric maintainer
can adopt the work into a pull request when appropriate. Do not report security
vulnerabilities through a public issue or pull request; follow the [security
policy](SECURITY.md). Public issue and pull request comments remain welcome and
do not require developer access.

## Development Setup

This section collects the setup steps needed before building, testing, or
contributing changes.

### Source Development

Install these tools before you start:

- **Rust** (stable toolchain) -- install with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Python** >= 3.11
- **Node.js** >= 20.18.3 with npm
- **uv** -- follow the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- **just** >= 1.50.0 -- `cargo install just --locked`

Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and build the Rust,
Python, and TypeScript packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric.git
cd NeMo-Fabric

uv venv --seed .venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
just install-hermes-agent
uv sync --all-groups --all-extras
just no_uv=true build-all
```

In the above, replace `3.13` with the Python version you want to use for development.

Verify the checkout by running the test suites described in [Testing](#testing).

### Package Installation

To build Python packages (wheels) locally from a source checkout:

```bash
just wheels
```

The resulting wheel files are placed in the `dist/` directory. Install the
packages into a virtual environment with:

```bash
uv pip install --find-links ./dist nemo-fabric
```

Hermes Agent 0.20 and later is not installable from PyPI. For local development,
check out the pinned Hermes source and synchronize it into the project
environment with:

```bash
just install-hermes-agent
```

The recipe checks out Hermes Agent under `external/hermes-agent` and installs
it as the editable source declared in `pyproject.toml`. End users should follow
the [Hermes Agent installation guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/installation)
and install `nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes` without a harness extra.

Refer to the [installation guide](docs/getting-started/install.mdx) for the
complete list of adapters and installation options.



## Release Tagging

Release tags use SemVer with a leading `v`.

- Use `v0.1.0` for stable releases.
- Use `v0.1.0-rc.1` for prereleases.
- Do not use tags such as `0.1.0` or `0.1.0-rc.1`.

## Code Style

These style requirements keep contributions consistent across Rust, Python,
and general repository files.

### Rust

Use these commands and conventions when changing the core runtime, CLI, or
native Python extension:

- **Formatting**: `cargo fmt --all`
- **Format check**: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- **Compilation check**: `cargo check --workspace --locked`

### Python

Follow the existing style in the Python SDK, adapters, examples, and tests.
Use type annotations for public APIs and keep native binding declarations in
sync with their Rust implementations.

### TypeScript

Use strict TypeScript for the adapter-contract binding. Preserve the JSON wire
property names, run the checked-in generator instead of editing generated
declarations, and keep production dependencies out of the contract package.

### General

Use the naming conventions appropriate to each language. Rust and Python use
`snake_case` for functions and variables. Rust, Python, and TypeScript types use
`PascalCase`. TypeScript contract properties preserve the wire `snake_case`
names.

## Testing

**Run tests for every language surface affected by your changes.** If a change
touches the Rust core or public adapter-contract schemas, run the Rust, Python,
and TypeScript suites because both language bindings depend on the generated
wire contract.

Run the affected test targets through the repository `justfile`:

```bash
# Rust workspace
just test-rust

# Python SDK, adapters, integrations, and examples
just test-python

# TypeScript adapter contract
just test-typescript

# All supported language surfaces
just test-all
```

If the virtual environment is already synchronized, use `no_uv=true` to avoid
reinstalling dependencies:

```bash
just no_uv=true test-python
just no_uv=true test-all
```

When adding functionality, include tests in the corresponding Rust crate or in
the relevant area under `tests/`. Public contract changes must keep the
checked-in JSON Schema snapshots, Python representations, and generated
TypeScript declarations synchronized.

## Documentation Checklist

If your change affects public behavior, adapters, examples, or workspace
structure, update the corresponding documentation in the same branch.

Before opening a PR, check the following:

1. Confirm that `README.md` reflects the current workspace, supported adapters,
   and top-level documentation.
2. Update the relevant SDK or API reference docs for public API changes.
3. Update the relevant adapter or example `README.md` when that surface changes.
4. Update embedded examples, integration docs, and adapter-support notes to
   reflect the current behavior.
5. For docs site changes, run `just docs` to regenerate the Python and Rust API
   references and validate the Fern configuration.

For documentation-heavy changes, prefer small targeted commits so the history
clearly separates entry-point changes, reference changes, examples, and
maintenance updates.

## DCO Sign-Off
* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.
  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.
* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

## Pull Request Process

This section describes how to prepare and submit changes for review.

### Before Submitting

Complete these checks before opening or updating a pull request:

1. Open or identify an issue describing the proposed enhancement or bug fix.
   External contributors should use a GitHub issue; NVIDIA contributors may use a GitHub or Linear issue.
2. Run the relevant test suites and confirm they pass.
3. Verify the affected packages compile with `just build-rust`,
   `just build-python`, or `just build-all`.
4. Update the relevant documentation entry points and references.
5. Rebase your branch on the latest `main` to avoid merge conflicts.

### PR Description

Complete the pull request template:

- **Overview**: Summarize the change and explain why it is needed.
- **Where should the reviewer start?**: Point to the most important file, test,
  or design decision.
- **Related issues**: Link the issue with the appropriate action keyword.
- **Testing**: List the checks you ran and any tests you added.
- **Breaking changes**: Call out public API or configuration changes that affect
  existing users.

### Review Expectations

- All PRs require at least one approving review before merge.
- Reviewers may request changes for code quality, test coverage,
  documentation, or design concerns.
- Address review feedback by pushing additional commits; do not force-push
  during review.
- CI must pass before merging.

## Commit Message Conventions

Use the following format for commit messages:

```text
