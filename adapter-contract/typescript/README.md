# NVIDIA NeMo Fabric Adapter Contract

Dependency-free TypeScript types for implementing adapters against the NVIDIA
NeMo Fabric adapter contract. The package is generated from the versioned JSON
Schemas maintained in the NeMo Fabric repository.

## Install

Install the package from the public npm registry:

```bash
npm install nemo-fabric-adapter-contract
```

Use Node.js 20.18.3 or later and TypeScript 5.6 or later. The TypeScript floor
ensures NodeNext consumers can import the bundled JSON Schemas. Use a compatible
TypeScript module pair: `module: "NodeNext"` with
`moduleResolution: "NodeNext"`, or `module: "ESNext"` with
`moduleResolution: "bundler"`. Enable `resolveJsonModule` when importing the
bundled JSON Schemas.

The package is ESM-only and does not support CommonJS `require`. NodeNext
consumers must set `"type": "module"` in their `package.json`.

## Stable v1alpha2 Contract

The root entry point contains the negotiated descriptor, southbound agent
configuration, and runtime context types:

```typescript
import { ADAPTER_CONTRACT_VERSION } from "nemo-fabric-adapter-contract";
import type {
  AdapterDescriptor,
  AgentConfig,
  RuntimeContext,
} from "nemo-fabric-adapter-contract";

const descriptor: AdapterDescriptor = {
  contract_version: ADAPTER_CONTRACT_VERSION,
  adapter_id: "com.acme.fabric.example",
  adapter_kind: "http",
};
```

Property names intentionally match the JSON wire format and remain
`snake_case`. Optional properties are distinct from properties whose value may
be `null`.

Use the maintained
[adapter contract documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/tree/main/docs/adapter-contract)
for the implementation sequence and the bundled schemas for runtime
validation.

## Invocation Types

The package root also exports the same request and result models as the Python
adapter-contract package:

```typescript
import type {
  AgentRunRequest,
  AgentRunResult,
} from "nemo-fabric-adapter-contract";
```

The local-host transport validates requests against the typed invocation
boundary and requires adapters to return a valid `AgentRunResult` before NeMo
Fabric normalizes the result. Token counts originate from JSON Schema `uint64`
values but are represented as JavaScript `number`; values greater than
`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` cannot be represented exactly.

## JSON Schemas

The package bundles byte-identical copies of the canonical schemas. Consumers
that need runtime validation can use their validator of choice, for example:

```typescript
import agentConfigSchema from "nemo-fabric-adapter-contract/schemas/agent-config" with { type: "json" };
```

The TypeScript declarations provide compile-time checking only. They do not
apply schema defaults or enforce runtime constraints such as string patterns,
numeric ranges, or relative paths.

## Development

From this directory:

```bash
npm ci
npm run generate:check
npm test
```

Run `npm run generate` after the canonical schemas change. Generated source and
schema copies are committed so drift is reviewable.

### Build Dependencies

`json-schema-to-typescript` generates declarations from the canonical JSON
Schemas. A hand-maintained declaration hierarchy was rejected because it would
create a second contract authority; a custom generator would duplicate an
existing focused build tool. `typescript` compiles the package and strict
positive and negative fixtures; transpilers cannot replace its type checker.
Both dependencies are exact-pinned build inputs and neither is present in the
published production dependency graph.

The resolved development graph includes `argparse@2.0.1` under `Python-2.0`.
That build-only license remains an explicit dependency-approver review item.
