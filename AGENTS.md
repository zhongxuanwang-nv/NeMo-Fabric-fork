## Agent Skills

NeMo Fabric ships two tiers of agent skills. Use the tier that matches your task:

- **Integration skills — `skills/`.** For integrating NeMo Fabric into an
  external application through the public Python SDK or building a third-party
  adapter through the published adapter contract. They are self-contained and
  exportable, depending only on supported public contracts and documentation,
  never on repository internals.
  Start with [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md).
- **Maintainer skills — `.agents/skills/`.** For contributing to NeMo Fabric
  itself: API, documentation, testing, CI, packaging, release, and PR
  preparation. They may reference repository internals and contribution
  commands. Start with [`.agents/skills/README.md`](.agents/skills/README.md).

Keep the tiers separate: do not add external integration guidance to the
maintainer set, or repository-internal contribution steps to the integration set.
Coding agents that auto-discover skills read the maintainer set from
`.agents/skills/` (also exposed at `.claude/skills` for Claude Code); the
integration set under `skills/` is meant to be exported into another project.

Key conventions for the two tiers:

- **Discovery wiring:** `.claude/skills` symlinks to `.agents/skills/` (the
  maintainer set) for Claude Code; integration skills under `skills/` are copied
  into another project rather than auto-discovered from this repository
  (see [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md)).
- **Portability strategy:** integration skills link to public GitHub documentation
  and example URLs rather than a docs-site domain, so they keep working when
  exported.
- **Supported integration surface:** the integration tier ships
  `skills/nemo-fabric-integrate` for typed Python SDK integration and
  `skills/nemo-fabric-build-adapter` for third-party adapter authoring. Future
  integration skills also live directly under `skills/` so they can be
  validated and published independently; repository-internal adapter
  maintenance stays in `.agents/skills/`.

## Documentation And Contribution Workflow

These workflow notes keep public documentation, examples, and PR preparation aligned
with repository expectations.

- Update user-facing entry points when public behavior, the `nemo-fabric` package (imported as `nemo_fabric`), examples, or supported bindings change: `README.md`, the Fern docs under `docs/` (navigation in `docs/index.yml`, site config in `fern/docs.yml`), and the adapter/integration READMEs (`adapters/*/README.md`, `sdk/python/nemo-fabric-runtime/src/nemo_fabric/integrations/*/README.md`, `examples/README.md`).
- Keep public bindings current when the API changes: `docs/sdk/python.mdx` for
  the Python SDK; `adapter-contract/python/` and
  `adapter-contract/typescript/` for the southbound adapter contract; the JSON
  Schema notes in `schemas/SCHEMA.md`;
  the generated references under `docs/reference/api/`; and the integration
  skills under `skills/` (which restate public contracts and must be kept in
  parity). Regenerate docs with `just docs` after changing the docs site.
- Keep release policy and the end-to-end maintainer workflow in `RELEASING.md`; keep packaging implementation guidance in `.agents/skills/maintain-packaging/SKILL.md`. Do not move release-history policy into user-facing docs or add a duplicate `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep the stable public wrapper `scripts/generate_api_docs.sh` at the `scripts/` root in docs and examples. Reference namespaced helper paths under `scripts/docs/` only when documenting internal maintenance work.
- Use branch prefixes for your work: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `test/`, or `refactor/`.
- Name branches after the work, never the Linear ticket. Do not embed ticket IDs or slugs in the branch name (e.g. use `feat/notebooks-onboarding`, not `feat/fabric-70-notebooks-onboarding`). This rule has historically been overlooked, so double-check the branch name before pushing or opening a PR.
- Use Conventional Commit PR titles (`<type>: <summary>`) as required by `.coderabbit.yaml` and the `prepare-pr` skill; reserve `fix` for actual product bugs, not CI, docs, or chores.
- Use signed-off commits for PR work: `git commit -s`.
- When creating a pull request from the current branch, target the upstream repository rather than a fork.
- Before creating, opening, publishing, or editing a pull request, read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and use it as the PR body skeleton (or `gh pr create --template .github/pull_request_template.md`). Preserve its visible headings (`Overview`, `Where should the reviewer start?`, `Related Issues`) and its contribution checkboxes; fill the sections instead of replacing them with a generic summary.
- If repo-local PR guidance such as the `prepare-pr` skill conflicts with generic GitHub connector or plugin guidance, follow the repo-local PR guidance for PR body format and review handoff details.
- PR descriptions should include what changed, why, how it was tested, and any breaking changes within the repository template format.
