# Stage 1: Describe the Adapter

An Adapter Descriptor tells NVIDIA NeMo Fabric how to locate an adapter and
which contract surface it implements. NeMo Fabric reads and validates this
record during planning without importing or starting the adapter.

Adapter Descriptor filenames end in `.fabric-adapter.json`.

## Create a Minimum Descriptor

The following descriptor is enough to declare an in-process Python adapter
that accepts an empty `AgentConfig` and implements only the required lifecycle:

```json
{
  "contract_version": "fabric.adapter/v1alpha2",
  "adapter_id": "com.acme.fabric.example",
  "adapter_kind": "python",
  "runner": {
    "module": "acme_fabric_adapter.runtime"
  }
}
```

Use a globally stable `adapter_id`. Treat it as a machine identifier, not a
display name. Adapters receive `AgentConfig`; `FabricConfig` never crosses the
southbound boundary.

The primary descriptor fields are:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `contract_version` | Selects the complete negotiated adapter contract. Use `fabric.adapter/v1alpha2`. |
| `adapter_id` | Identifies the adapter implementation during selection and planning. |
| `adapter_kind` | Selects the runtime binding: `python`, `process`, `http`, or `native_plugin`. |
| `runner` | Supplies binding-specific startup metadata, such as a Python module. |
| `requirements` | Describes binaries, environment-variable names, files, services, or plugin hooks for diagnostics. |
| `config` | Declares the normalized fields the adapter applies and target-native files it generates. |
| `capabilities` | Declares optional runtime operations implemented through the adapter binding. |
| `telemetry` | Declares telemetry outputs and integration modes the adapter produces or forwards. |
| `target_types` | Declares registered target types a shared adapter can load. Omit it for a direct harness or dedicated-agent adapter. |

Use the canonical
[`adapter-descriptor.schema.json`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/blob/main/schemas/adapter-contract/adapter-descriptor.schema.json)
for exact fields, defaults, and constraints.

## Declare Accepted Configuration

Add a `config.accepts` value only after the implementation applies that field.
For example, the following adapter accepts named models, model endpoints,
system instructions, and a target-applied turn limit:

```json
"config": {
  "accepts": [
    "models",
    "models.base_url",
    "instructions.system",
    "runtime.max_turns"
  ]
}
```

Accepting a parent does not automatically accept every optional child. For
example, `models` accepts the base model block, while
`models.temperature` and `models.base_url` are separate declarations. Use the
schema enum for the exact accepted values.

Planning rejects configured normalized behavior outside the declared surface.
NeMo Fabric does not silently remove unsupported fields.

## Add Adapter-Owned Schemas

Use an Adapter Descriptor schema for target-specific data that cannot be
validated by the normalized contract alone:

| Descriptor Field | Validates |
| --- | --- |
| `settings_schema` | `FabricConfig.harness.settings` for this adapter. |
| `model_schema` | Every configured model role, including provider compatibility and closed model settings. |
| `tool_definition_schema` | Every normalized named tool or tool-group definition. |
| `extension_schemas` | Adapter-owned data at named southbound extension points. |

The following closed settings schema permits one optional command timeout:

```json
"settings_schema": {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "command_timeout": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 1
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Use a closed object with no properties when the adapter accepts
`harness.settings` but has no settings. Omit the schema when the adapter does
not support that configuration surface.

Schemas must be valid, self-contained JSON Schema objects. NeMo Fabric does not
load arbitrary HTTP or file references during planning. Use
`additionalProperties: false` unless an intentionally open compatibility
surface is part of the adapter contract.

## Register Targets for a Shared Adapter

A shared framework adapter separates its static implementation descriptor from
the custom agents it can load. The Adapter Descriptor declares the supported
target type:

```json
{
  "contract_version": "fabric.adapter/v1alpha2",
  "adapter_id": "com.acme.fabric.framework",
  "adapter_kind": "python",
  "target_types": ["workflow"],
  "runner": {
    "module": "acme_framework_adapter.runtime"
  },
  "config": {
    "accepts": ["models", "tools.definitions"]
  }
}
```

Each separately installed workflow publishes one `*.fabric-target.json`
Adapter Target Descriptor. The target record selects its adapter, fixes the
adapter-scoped entry point, and validates that target's workflow settings:

```json
{
  "contract_version": "fabric.adapter/v1alpha2",
  "type": "workflow",
  "id": "com.acme.email-phishing",
  "adapter_id": "com.acme.fabric.framework",
  "spec": {
    "entrypoint": {
      "kind": "factory",
      "ref": "acme.agent.react"
    },
    "settings_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "llm_name": {
          "type": "string",
          "minLength": 1
        }
      },
      "required": ["llm_name"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

The Adapter Target Descriptor uses the same `contract_version` as the Adapter
Descriptor. It does not introduce another contract or schema version.
`workflow.target_id` selects the target by `id`; consumer configuration does
not repeat its adapter-specific entry point.

Use the canonical
[`adapter-target-descriptor.schema.json`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/blob/main/schemas/adapter-contract/adapter-target-descriptor.schema.json)
for the complete target record.

## Keep Claims Exact

Declare only behavior implemented through the adapter boundary. A target's
native cancellation or streaming feature does not become a NeMo Fabric
capability until the adapter binding implements the corresponding contract.
Relay-backed ATOF streaming does not require `capabilities.streaming`; that
flag is reserved for the optional native OpenAI streaming operation.

Next, [map normalized configuration](normalized-configuration.md) and implement
only the fields listed in `config.accepts`.
