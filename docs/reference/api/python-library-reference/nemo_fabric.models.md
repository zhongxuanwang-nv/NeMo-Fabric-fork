# <kbd>module</kbd> `nemo_fabric.models`

Pydantic SDK models for NVIDIA NeMo Fabric configuration and requests.

The Rust core remains the source of truth for persisted schema snapshots. These models provide the Python SDK's typed authoring surface and intentionally keep extension fields so consumers can carry adapter- or application-owned data without waiting for a schema release.
