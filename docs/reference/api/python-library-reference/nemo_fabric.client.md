# <kbd>module</kbd> `nemo_fabric.client`

Native Python client for resolving and running NVIDIA NeMo Fabric agents.



---


## <kbd>class</kbd> `Fabric`

Primary Python entrypoint for NeMo Fabric.

Every lifecycle method accepts a complete, typed ``FabricConfig`` plus an optional ``base_dir`` used to resolve relative paths. Compose variants in Python before calling the SDK. The ``doctor()``, ``plan()``, and ``run()`` results are typed, read-only mapping models. ``start_runtime()`` returns an active ``Runtime`` handle.

``Fabric`` uses the native Rust extension. SDK calls raise ``FabricNativeUnavailableError`` when the native extension is not installed.

See the Getting Started overview for runnable single-invocation, typed-config, and multi-turn examples.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `doctor`

```python
async def doctor(
    config: FabricConfig,
    *,
    base_dir: str | os.PathLike[str] | None = None,
) -> DoctorReport
```

Diagnose a planned agent without starting its runtime.

Doctor checks the resolved adapter, capability mappings, and declared environment requirements using the native NeMo Fabric core.



**Args:**

 - <b>`config`</b>:  Complete typed ``FabricConfig``.
 - <b>`base_dir`</b>:  Base directory for resolving relative paths.



**Returns:**
 A ``DoctorReport`` with aggregate status and ordered checks.



**Raises:**

 - <b>`FabricConfigError`</b>:  If inputs or native diagnostic output are  invalid.
 - <b>`FabricNativeUnavailableError`</b>:  If the native extension is not  installed.

---


### <kbd>method</kbd> `plan`

```python
def plan(
    config: FabricConfig,
    *,
    base_dir: str | os.PathLike[str] | None = None,
) -> RunPlan
```

Resolve a complete typed configuration into an immutable execution plan.

Planning resolves the selected adapter and reports optional runtime capabilities such as streaming, updates, and cancellation. Planning does not start the runtime.



**Args:**

 - <b>`config`</b>:  Complete typed ``FabricConfig``. Raw mappings are not  accepted.
 - <b>`base_dir`</b>:  Base directory for resolving relative paths.



**Returns:**
 A ``RunPlan`` containing the canonical config, path context, adapter, and declared runtime capabilities.



**Raises:**

 - <b>`FabricConfigError`</b>:  If the config or adapter resolution is invalid.
 - <b>`FabricNativeUnavailableError`</b>:  If the native extension is not  installed.

---


### <kbd>method</kbd> `run`

```python
async def run(
    config: FabricConfig,
    *,
    base_dir: str | os.PathLike[str] | None = None,
    input: Any = None,
    request: RunRequest | None = None,
) -> RunResult
```

Execute one complete start, invoke, and stop lifecycle.

``input`` and ``request`` are mutually exclusive. Omitting both produces an empty text input. Use ``RunRequest`` when the invocation needs a caller-owned request ID, context, or overrides. NeMo Fabric attempts to stop a started runtime even when invocation fails.



**Args:**

 - <b>`config`</b>:  Complete typed ``FabricConfig``.
 - <b>`base_dir`</b>:  Base directory for resolving relative paths.
 - <b>`input`</b>:  JSON-compatible invocation input.
 - <b>`request`</b>:  Complete validated ``RunRequest``.



**Returns:**
 The normalized ``RunResult``, including output, artifacts, telemetry references, lifecycle events, and structured error data. If shutdown fails after invocation completes, the result is marked failed while preserving its output and recording the stop error in ``error`` and ``metadata.cleanup_errors``.



**Raises:**

 - <b>`FabricConfigError`</b>:  If input and request are combined, request data is not  JSON-compatible, or config resolution fails.
 - <b>`FabricNativeUnavailableError`</b>:  If the native extension is not  installed.
 - <b>`FabricRuntimeError`</b>:  If the native runtime lifecycle fails before a  normalized result can be returned.

### <kbd>method</kbd> `start_runtime`

```python
async def start_runtime(
    config: FabricConfig,
    *,
    base_dir: str | os.PathLike[str] | None = None,
    overrides: Mapping[str, Any] | None = None,
    streaming: bool = False,
) -> Runtime
```

Start a stateful runtime for one or more ordered invocations.

Each call starts a new logical runtime. Runtime-scoped overrides are recursively merged below invocation-scoped overrides. Set ``streaming=True`` with NVIDIA NeMo Relay enabled to provision the SDK-owned ATOF endpoint used by ``Runtime.invoke_stream()``.



**Args:**

 - <b>`config`</b>:  Complete typed ``FabricConfig``.
 - <b>`base_dir`</b>:  Base directory for resolving relative paths.
 - <b>`overrides`</b>:  JSON-compatible overrides applied to every invocation  in the runtime unless superseded by invocation overrides.
 - <b>`streaming`</b>:  Whether to provision NeMo Relay ATOF streaming for  ``Runtime.invoke_stream()``.



**Returns:**
 An active ``Runtime``. Use it as an asynchronous context manager to guarantee runtime shutdown.



**Raises:**

 - <b>`FabricConfigError`</b>:  If inputs or overrides are invalid, or streaming  is requested without NeMo Relay enabled.
 - <b>`FabricNativeUnavailableError`</b>:  If the native extension is not  installed.
 - <b>`FabricRuntimeError`</b>:  If runtime startup fails.
