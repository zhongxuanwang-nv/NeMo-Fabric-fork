# <kbd>module</kbd> `nemo_fabric.runtime`

Runtime lifecycle support for the NVIDIA NeMo Fabric Python SDK.



---


## <kbd>class</kbd> `RuntimeStatus`

Lifecycle state of a runtime.

``ACTIVE`` accepts invocations, ``STOPPED`` has released its runtime, and ``FAILED`` records a lifecycle failure that prevents further invocations but still permits cleanup.






### Inheritance

Direct bases: `str`, `Enum`.

### Values

The enum defines the following values:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ACTIVE` | `active` |
| `STOPPED` | `stopped` |
| `FAILED` | `failed` |

---


## <kbd>class</kbd> `Runtime`

One logical, stateful harness execution.

Create runtimes with ``Fabric.start_runtime()`` rather than calling the constructor. A runtime serializes invocations and preserves adapter-owned harness state across turns. Use it as an asynchronous context manager to stop the runtime on exit.

Runtime-scoped overrides are recursively merged with invocation overrides; invocation values win.


---

### <kbd>property</kbd> handle

Return a detached snapshot of the runtime handle.

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> invocations

Return copied request, runtime, and invocation IDs for completed turns.

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> messages

Return a deep copy of the latest harness-provided message history.

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> runtime_id

Return the unique identifier for this started runtime lifecycle.

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> status

Return the current ``ACTIVE``, ``STOPPED``, or ``FAILED`` state.

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> supports_openai_streaming

Return whether the selected adapter implements native OpenAI streaming.

---

### <kbd>property</kbd> supports_streaming

Return whether NVIDIA NeMo Relay ATOF streaming is enabled.



---


### <kbd>method</kbd> `invoke`

```python
async def invoke(*, input: Any = None, request: RunRequest | None = None) -> RunResult
```

Run one turn on this runtime.

``input`` and ``request`` are mutually exclusive. Runtime overrides are merged below invocation overrides from ``RunRequest``. Concurrent turns on the same runtime are rejected.



**Args:**

 - <b>`input`</b>:  JSON-compatible turn input.
 - <b>`request`</b>:  Complete validated ``RunRequest``.



**Returns:**
 The normalized ``RunResult`` for this turn.



**Raises:**

 - <b>`FabricConfigError`</b>:  If request fields conflict or are not  JSON-compatible.
 - <b>`FabricStateError`</b>:  If the runtime is not active, is stopping, or is  already running a turn.
 - <b>`FabricNativeUnavailableError`</b>:  If the native extension is missing.
 - <b>`FabricRuntimeError`</b>:  If native invocation fails before returning a  normalized result.

---


### <kbd>method</kbd> `invoke_openai_stream`

```python
def invoke_openai_stream(
    *,
    input: Any = None,
    request: RunRequest | None = None,
) -> OpenAIInvokeStream
```

Start one turn and stream native OpenAI chat-completion chunks.

The returned stream yields ``chat.completion.chunk`` mappings. Await ``stream.result()`` for the separate normalized terminal result.



**Raises:**

 - <b>`FabricCapabilityError`</b>:  If the selected adapter does not advertise  native OpenAI streaming.
 - <b>`FabricConfigError`</b>:  If request fields conflict or are not  JSON-compatible.
 - <b>`FabricStateError`</b>:  If another turn or stream is active.

---


### <kbd>method</kbd> `invoke_stream`

```python
def invoke_stream(
    *,
    input: Any = None,
    request: RunRequest | None = None,
) -> InvokeStream
```

Start one turn and stream raw NeMo Relay ATOF records as they arrive.

``input`` and ``request`` are mutually exclusive. The returned ``InvokeStream`` yields raw ATOF dictionaries. Await ``stream.result()`` for the terminal normalized ``RunResult``.



**Raises:**

 - <b>`FabricCapabilityError`</b>:  If the runtime was not started with NeMo Relay  enabled and ``streaming=True``.
 - <b>`FabricConfigError`</b>:  If request fields conflict or are not  JSON-compatible.
 - <b>`FabricStateError`</b>:  If another turn or stream is active.

---


### <kbd>method</kbd> `stop`

```python
async def stop() -> None
```

Destroy an idle runtime exactly once.

Repeated calls after a successful stop are no-ops. A failed runtime may still be stopped so its resources are released.



**Raises:**

 - <b>`FabricStateError`</b>:  If the runtime is already stopping or has an  invocation in flight.
 - <b>`FabricNativeUnavailableError`</b>:  If the native extension is missing.
 - <b>`FabricRuntimeError`</b>:  If native runtime shutdown fails.
