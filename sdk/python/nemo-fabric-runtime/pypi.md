`nemo-fabric-runtime` provides the Python SDK and native Rust bindings for
NVIDIA NeMo Fabric, a runtime execution layer for agents.

Typically this is installed using the [`nemo-fabric`](https://pypi.org/project/nemo-fabric/) meta package.

```bash
pip install nemo-fabric
```

Installing the runtime package directly is equivalent:

```bash
pip install nemo-fabric-runtime
```

The package exposes the `nemo_fabric` Python module for typed agent
configuration, validation, run planning, runtime lifecycle management,
normalized results, artifacts, diagnostics, and telemetry references.

Refer to the [NeMo Fabric documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/fabric)
for installation and usage guidance. Source code is available in the
[NVIDIA NeMo Fabric repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric).
