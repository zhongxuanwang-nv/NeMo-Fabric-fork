# Harbor Integration

Use `nemo_fabric.integrations.harbor:FabricAgent` to run NVIDIA NeMo Fabric
adapters in Harbor tasks. Harbor options select the model, harness, skills, MCP
servers, tool policy, and telemetry; `FabricAgent` translates them into one
typed `FabricConfig` for the task run.

Refer to the [Harbor example](../../../../../../../examples/harbor/README.md)
for runnable SWE-Bench commands, configuration variations, reward checks, and
Relay artifacts.
