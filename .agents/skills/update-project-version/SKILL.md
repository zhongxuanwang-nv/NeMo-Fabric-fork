# Update Project Version

## Companion Guidance

Use `karpathy-guidelines` alongside this skill for implementation or review
work. Keep changes scoped, surface assumptions, and define focused validation
before editing.

Use this skill when changing the NeMo Fabric version, including
pre-release or build-metadata variants used during packaging.

## Source Of Truth

- `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.package].version` is the source of truth for the Rust
  workspace and the release version stamped into Python and TypeScript package
  metadata.
- Keep `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]` self-references aligned when the
  workspace version changes.
- `sdk/python/nemo-fabric-runtime/pyproject.toml` is the exception among the
  Python projects: do not add a literal `project.version`. Keep
  `project.dynamic = ["version"]` because Maturin derives
  `nemo-fabric-runtime`'s version from
  `crates/fabric-python/Cargo.toml`, which inherits the workspace version.
- The setuptools projects do not derive their versions from Cargo. Update the
  literal `project.version` in every one of these files:
  - `sdk/python/nemo-fabric/pyproject.toml`
  - `adapter-contract/python/pyproject.toml`
  - `adapters/**/pyproject.toml`
- Keep internal Python package requirement pins aligned with the Python release
  version:
  - The unconditional `nemo-fabric-runtime == <version>` dependency in the
    published `sdk/python/nemo-fabric/pyproject.toml`.
  - All `nemo-fabric-* == <version>` requirements in its optional dependencies.
  - Each adapter's `nemo-fabric-adapters-common == <version>` dependency.
- Keep `adapter-contract/typescript/package.json` and the root package entries in
  its `package-lock.json` aligned with the Cargo SemVer release version.

For a normal release, use the same `X.Y.Z` string everywhere. For a prerelease
or build-metadata version, use valid Cargo SemVer in `Cargo.toml` and the
equivalent PEP 440 version in explicit Python metadata. Confirm that the
Maturin-built runtime and setuptools-built packages resolve to equivalent
versions rather than blindly copying incompatible syntax.

## Workflow

1. Read the current version from `Cargo.toml` and decide the exact Cargo,
   Python, and TypeScript target version strings.
2. Run `just set-version <cargo-version>`. The recipe preserves the normalized
   SemVer for Cargo and TypeScript, converts it to PEP 440 for Python, and
   updates:
   - `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.package].version`
   - `Cargo.toml` `workspace.dependencies.nemo-fabric-core.version`
   - The setuptools `project.version` in the published SDK metapackage,
     Python adapter contract, and every adapter `pyproject.toml`
   - Every internal `nemo-fabric-*` exact-version requirement
   - The TypeScript adapter-contract `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - `Cargo.lock` through Cargo metadata resolution
   - The root, runtime, and adapter `uv.lock` files through `just lock-python`
3. Confirm that `sdk/python/nemo-fabric-runtime/pyproject.toml` remains dynamic
   and unchanged.
4. Audit references to the old version with targeted searches. Distinguish
   package-version surfaces from examples and unrelated dependency versions.

If editing the helper code, keep these contracts aligned:

- `set_project_version` must call the Cargo, Python, and TypeScript project
  version helpers.
- `set_cargo_workspace_version` must update the workspace version and the
  `nemo-fabric-core` workspace dependency, then verify every `nemo-fabric-*` workspace
  package through Cargo metadata.
- `set_python_project_versions` must update the published SDK metapackage,
  Python adapter contract, every adapter `pyproject.toml` discovered
  recursively under `adapters/`, and all internal exact-version pins while
  rejecting a static version in
  `sdk/python/nemo-fabric-runtime/pyproject.toml`.
- `set_typescript_project_version` must update the package manifest and both
  root version entries in the npm lockfile without changing dependency versions.
- The `set-version` recipe must run `just lock-python` after source metadata is
  updated.

## Validation

- Inspect Cargo version fields:
  `rg -n '^version =|nemo-fabric-core = \{ path = .*version =' Cargo.toml`
- Inspect explicit Python versions and internal pins:
  `rg -n '^version =|nemo-fabric-[a-z-]+(?:\[[^]]+\])? == ' pyproject.toml sdk adapter-contract/python adapters --glob 'pyproject.toml'`
- Confirm the runtime remains dynamic:
  `rg -n 'dynamic = \["version"\]' sdk/python/nemo-fabric-runtime/pyproject.toml`
- Inspect the TypeScript package and lockfile root versions:
  `rg -n '"version":' adapter-contract/typescript/package{,-lock}.json`
- Run `cargo check --workspace --locked`.
- Run `just build-python` to verify all Python package metadata resolves.
- Run `just test-python` when the integration version or Python packaging
  behavior changes materially.
- Run `just wheels` for release-facing validation of every Python wheel.
- Run `just pack-typescript` to verify the stamped TypeScript package metadata.
- Run `git diff --check`.

## Avoid

- Updating only `Cargo.toml` and leaving the setuptools packages stale.
- Adding a literal version to `sdk/python/nemo-fabric-runtime/pyproject.toml`;
  Maturin owns that version.
- Updating Python package versions without their exact internal dependency pins.
- Forgetting `Cargo.lock`, the root `uv.lock`, or per-project `uv.lock` files.
- Updating the TypeScript package manifest without its npm lockfile root entry.
- Blind repository-wide replacement of version-like strings.
