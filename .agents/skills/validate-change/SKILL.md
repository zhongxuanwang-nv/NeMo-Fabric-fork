# Validate a Change

## Companion Guidance

Use `karpathy-guidelines` alongside this skill for implementation or review
work. Keep changes scoped, surface assumptions, and define focused validation
before editing.

Use this skill to choose the smallest validation set that still covers the
surfaces touched by a change.

## Mandatory Rules

- Format changed files with the language-native formatter before the final
  test pass.
- If Rust code changed, run `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `just test-rust`.
- If Python code or a Python-facing adapter changed, run `just test-python`.
- If the TypeScript adapter contract or one of its source schemas changed, run
  `just test-typescript`.
- If `crates/fabric-core` changed in a way exposed through Python, run both the
  Rust and Python suites.
- If the PyO3 bridge or package metadata changed, run `just build-python` and
  `cargo check -p fabric-python --locked`.
- If public configuration types changed, confirm the schema snapshot tests in
  `just test-rust` pass and review generated schema diffs.
- If an adapter or integration changed, run its focused tests.
- If a Cargo or Python manifest or lockfile changed, run
  `uv run --no-project python scripts/licensing/license_diff.py --base-ref origin/main`,
  review the transitive license changes, then run the `attributions-rust` and
  `attributions-python` pre-commit hooks.
- If the TypeScript manifest or npm lockfile changed, inspect the complete npm
  dependency tree and license fields, confirm the package still has zero
  production dependencies, run the `attributions-node` pre-commit hook, and run
  its package and audit checks.
- If documentation or examples changed, run `just docs` when practical and
  verify documented commands against the current repository.
- If code changes alter APIs, commands, paths, packaging behavior, telemetry
  semantics, or documented best practices, update dependent maintainer skills in
  the same branch. Because the consumer skills under `skills/` restate SDK guide,
  Pydantic model, and Rust type details, update them in parity whenever those
  surfaces change.

## Start With the Change Shape

- **Rust core, CLI, or shared runtime semantics changed**
  Run Rust formatting and tests. Add Python tests when the behavior is exposed through the SDK, and run relevant tests for CLI behavior.
- **Python SDK or PyO3 binding changed**
  Use `python-tests`, run focused pytest tests first, then run
  `just test-python`. Rebuild with `just build-python` when native code or
  packaging changed.
- **Adapter behavior changed**
  Run the focused adapter tests under `tests/adapters`, then `just test-python`.
- **Harbor integration changed**
  Run `tests/test_harbor_runner.py`, then `just test-python`.
- **Schema or public contract changed**
  Run the Rust, Python, and TypeScript suites and review changes under
  `schemas/`, the checked-in Python adapter-contract representations, generated
  TypeScript sources, and generated API references.
- **Documentation-only change**
  Use `contribute-docs` and `review-doc-style`. Run `just docs` for docs-site or
  generated-reference changes.
- **CI or packaging changed**
  Use `maintain-ci` or `maintain-packaging`, then run the recipes and checks
  whose behavior changed.

## Core Validation Matrix

```bash
just test-rust
just test-python
just test-typescript
```

## Common Targeted Commands

```bash
# Rust
just build-rust
just test-rust
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check -p fabric-python --locked

# Python and native extension
just build-python
just test-python
uv run --no-sync pytest -k "<pattern>"

# TypeScript adapter contract
just build-typescript
just test-typescript
just pack-typescript

# Documentation
just docs

# Dependency licenses
uv run --no-project python scripts/licensing/license_diff.py --base-ref origin/main
uv run pre-commit run --all-files attributions-rust
uv run pre-commit run --all-files attributions-python
uv run pre-commit run --all-files attributions-node

# Justfile and patch hygiene
just --fmt --check
git diff --check
```

## Hygiene Checks

Before review or handoff:

- Verify README and docs entry points still match current package names and
  paths.
- Verify examples use current `just` recipes and public commands.
- Call out checks that were not run and why.
- Run `git diff --check`.
