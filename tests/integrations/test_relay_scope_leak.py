"""Integration coverage for the Relay scope leak the Deep Agents adapter contains.

The Deep Agents unit tests monkeypatch a context manager that raises, which is enough to
pin result normalization but cannot reproduce the state leak: the real callback drops a
run from ``_scope_handles`` *before* its pop fails, so the scope stays on Relay's shared
stack and outlives the invocation. These tests drive the actual Relay callback and scope
so that behavior is covered rather than assumed.
