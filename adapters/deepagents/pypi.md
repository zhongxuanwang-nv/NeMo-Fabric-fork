`nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents` provides a NeMo Fabric adapter for use with [LangChain Deep Agents](https://www.langchain.com/deep-agents).

## Install

Installation can be performed using the `nemo-fabric` meta package with the `deepagents` extra, or by installing the adapter and harness packages separately. The following table shows which components each installation provides:

| Installation | Runtime | Adapter | Harness | NeMo Relay Python Package |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric[deepagents]"` | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric[deepagents,relay]"` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents[harness]"` | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents[full]"` | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents[relay]"` | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| `pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents` | No | Yes | No | No |

NeMo Relay is optional for ordinary runs. NeMo Relay telemetry and streaming
require one of the installations in the table that includes the NeMo Relay
Python package.
