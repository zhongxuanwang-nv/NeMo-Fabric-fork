`nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes` provides a NeMo Fabric adapter for use with [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/).

## Install

Hermes Agent and this adapter require Python versions 3.11 through 3.13.
Hermes Agent 0.20 and later is not installable from PyPI. Install Hermes Agent
by following the
[Hermes Agent installation guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/installation),
then install the NeMo Fabric packages into the Python environment that runs
Hermes Agent.

The following table shows which NeMo Fabric components each package expression
provides. None of these expressions installs Hermes Agent:

| Installation | Runtime | Adapter | Harness | NeMo Relay Python Package |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pip install nemo-fabric nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes` | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric[relay]" nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes` | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes[full]"` | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes[relay]"` | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| `pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes` | No | Yes | No | No |

NeMo Relay is optional for ordinary runs. NeMo Relay telemetry and streaming
require one of the installations in the table that includes the NeMo Relay
Python package.

Refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/fabric/getting-started/install) for more details.
