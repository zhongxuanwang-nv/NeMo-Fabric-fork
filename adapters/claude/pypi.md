`nemo-fabric-adapters-claude` provides a NeMo Fabric adapter for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

## Install

Installation can be performed using the `nemo-fabric` meta package with the `claude` extra, or by installing the adapter and harness packages separately. The following table shows which components each installation provides:

| Installation | Runtime | Adapter | Harness | NeMo Relay CLI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric[claude]"` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-claude[harness]"` | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-claude` | No | Yes | No | No |

The `full` extra is equivalent to `harness`. Both install the supported NeMo
Relay CLI so telemetry and streaming work without a separate CLI installation.

Refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/fabric/getting-started/install) for more details.
