# Examples

This directory holds runnable Fabric examples.

New to Fabric? Start with the [onboarding notebooks](notebooks/README.md) for a
guided, human-facing tour of the Python SDK, then come back to the runnable
examples below.

## Onboarding notebooks

[`notebooks`](notebooks/README.md) is a two-notebook tour of the Python SDK:
a quickstart (configure, plan, diagnose, run, inspect, and multi-turn) and a
variations notebook that runs the same agent across available harnesses and
varies its capabilities and telemetry.

## Code review agent

[`code_review_agent`](code_review_agent/README.md) demonstrates the
application-facing Python SDK contract:

- constructing complete `FabricConfig` values with Pydantic models;
- creating harness, environment, capability, and telemetry variants from deep
  copies;
- resolving relative workspace and skill paths with `base_dir`;
- running maintained Hermes, Codex, Claude, and Deep Agents adapters through the Python SDK.

Start with:

```bash
just build-all
.venv/bin/python -m examples.code_review_agent \
  --input "Reply with exactly: fabric works"
```

## Custom LangGraph agents

[`langgraph`](langgraph/README.md) holds two representative custom LangGraph
agents that validate the generic
[LangGraph adapter](../adapters/langgraph/README.md). One is an existing compiled
graph that runs unchanged; the other is a factory graph that opts into
Fabric-managed models, MCP tools, tool policy, and durable multi-turn state. Both
use the same adapter ID.

```bash
pip install -e '.[langgraph,runtime]'
pytest tests/adapters/test_langgraph_adapter.py
```

## Harbor

[`harbor`](harbor/README.md) demonstrates how to evaluate Fabric agents with
Harbor while preserving Fabric's typed configuration workflow. Harbor manages
the task environment, retries, concurrency, verification, rewards, and result
layout. `FabricAgent` translates Harbor inputs—including the harness, model,
skills, MCP servers, tool policy, and telemetry—into the final `FabricConfig`.

The walkthroughs include:

- a calculator walkthrough with a deterministic, credential-free integration
  smoke test and optional LLM-backed Hermes and Claude runs; and
- a SWE-Bench workflow for running Hermes and Claude, comparing capability
  variations, inspecting Relay telemetry, and verifying real coding tasks.

Start with the shared setup and execution model in the
[Harbor guide](harbor/README.md).
