# NVIDIA NeMo Fabric Examples

This directory holds runnable NeMo Fabric examples.

New to NeMo Fabric? Start with the [onboarding notebooks](notebooks/README.md) for a
guided, human-facing tour of the Python SDK, then come back to the runnable
examples below.

## Onboarding notebooks

[`notebooks`](notebooks/README.md) is a two-notebook tour of the Python SDK:
a quickstart (configure, plan, diagnose, run, inspect, and multi-turn) and a
variations notebook that runs the same agent across available harnesses and
varies its capabilities and telemetry.

## Code review agent

[`code_review_agent`](code_review_agent/README.md) demonstrates the
application-facing Python SDK contract:

- constructing complete `FabricConfig` values with Pydantic models;
- creating harness, environment, capability, and telemetry variants from deep
  copies;
- resolving relative workspace and skill paths with `base_dir`;
- running maintained Hermes Agent, Codex, Claude, and Deep Agents adapters through the Python SDK.

Complete the [code-review setup](code_review_agent/README.md#set-up), then run:

```bash
just build-all
.venv/bin/python -m examples.code_review_agent \
  --input "Reply with exactly: NeMo Fabric works"
```

## Pi JSONL-RPC Code Review

[`pi_jsonl_rpc_code_review`](pi_jsonl_rpc_code_review/README.md) exercises the
first-party [Pi adapter](../adapters/pi/README.md). It maps only the default
typed model and explicit skill paths into one persistent Pi JSONL-RPC process
per NeMo Fabric runtime.

## LangGraph Custom Agent

[`langgraph_custom_agent`](langgraph_custom_agent/README.md) demonstrates how
to build a dedicated NeMo Fabric adapter for a custom agent. It uses a small
email-phishing agent built directly with LangGraph and keeps each responsibility
in a separate directory:

- `consumer/` configures and runs the example with `FabricConfig`.
- `adapter/` receives `AgentConfig` and manages `start`, `invoke`, and `stop`.
- `agent/` contains the LangGraph application without NeMo Fabric-specific
  code.

Start with the model-backed example. You can then vary its model settings, add
a stdio MCP tool, or enable NeMo Relay telemetry.

## Harbor

[`harbor`](harbor/README.md) demonstrates how to evaluate NeMo Fabric agents with
Harbor while preserving NeMo Fabric's typed configuration workflow. Harbor manages
the task environment, retries, concurrency, verification, rewards, and result
layout. `FabricAgent` translates Harbor inputs—including the harness, model,
skills, MCP servers, tool policy, and telemetry—into the final `FabricConfig`.

The walkthroughs include:

- a calculator walkthrough with a deterministic, credential-free integration
  smoke test and optional LLM-backed Hermes Agent and Claude runs; and
- a SWE-Bench workflow for running Hermes Agent and Claude, comparing capability
  variations, inspecting Relay telemetry, and verifying real coding tasks.

Start with the shared setup and execution model in the
[Harbor guide](harbor/README.md).
