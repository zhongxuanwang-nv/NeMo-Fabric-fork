# Mapping Consumer Config To FabricConfig

Translate the consumer's own application, job, or deployment object into a typed
`FabricConfig` in memory. The consumer keeps owning its configuration model;
NVIDIA NeMo Fabric only receives the validated slice it needs.

## Public Config Models

Import these from the top-level `nemo_fabric` package:

| Model | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `FabricConfig` | Root config passed to every `Fabric` call. |
| `MetadataConfig` | Agent name and description. |
| `HarnessConfig` | `adapter_id`, `resolution`, and adapter-owned `settings`. |
| `WorkflowConfig` | Registered `target_id` and immutable construction settings. |
| `DiscoveryConfig` | Explicit local descriptor files and directories. |
| `ModelConfig` | Provider, model, credentials (`api_key_env`), endpoint, and sampling. |
| `InstructionsConfig` / `InstructionConfig` | Portable agent instructions and replacement mode. |
| `RuntimeConfig` | Input/output labels, artifact location, invocation timeout, and harness turn limit. |
| `EnvironmentConfig` | Execution environment, workspace, and harness-visible variables. |
| `ToolsConfig` / `ToolDefinitionConfig` | Named tool and tool-group definitions plus selection and blocking policy. |
| `McpConfig` / `McpServerConfig` | MCP transport, network URL or stdio executable, separate stdio process arguments and environment, exposure, and optional per-server tool policy. |
| `SkillConfig` | Skill directories. |
| `TelemetryConfig` | Telemetry providers. |
| `RelayConfig` and `Relay*Config` | NVIDIA NeMo Relay observability under the top-level `relay` block. |

The [models reference](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/blob/main/docs/reference/api/python-library-reference/nemo_fabric.models.md)
indexes the public config models. The generated pages omit constructor fields and
defaults, so read the installed `nemo_fabric` models (they ship `py.typed`) for
exact field names and defaults.

Claude and Codex validate every model role against their descriptor-owned
`model_schema`. Provider identifiers outside their native `anthropic` and
`openai` paths require both `ModelConfig.base_url` and
`ModelConfig.api_key_env`; undeclared `ModelConfig.settings` also fail planning.

## Build And Shape

Construct the nested config directly, then adjust capabilities with helper
methods that edit the typed config in place and return it:

- `add_skill_path(path)` / `remove_skill_path(path)`
- `add_mcp_server(name, *, transport, url, args, env, authentication, custom_headers, exposure, allowed_tools, blocked_tools, ...)` / `remove_mcp_server(name)`
- `enable_relay(...)` for NVIDIA NeMo Relay observability in the `relay` block
- `ToolsConfig(enabled=..., blocked=...)` for tool policy
- `add_tool_definition(name, kind=..., ref=..., settings=...)` / `remove_tool_definition(name)`
- `block_tools(...)` for additive deny policy

For a stdio MCP server, set `url` to the executable and pass each command-line
argument as a separate `args` element.

Use `add_tool_definition(...)` only when the selected adapter accepts
`tools.definitions` and publishes a `tool_definition_schema`.

Filtered per-server MCP configurations require adapter support for both `mcp`
and `mcp.tool_filters`. An unfiltered server with `allowed_tools=None` and an
empty or omitted `blocked_tools` list requires only `mcp`. `allowed_tools=None`
exposes every discovered tool, while `allowed_tools=[]` exposes none. NeMo Fabric
removes `blocked_tools` after applying the allowlist. Tool names in both lists
must be non-blank, and planning rejects a tool that appears in both lists.
MCP servers requiring authentication additionally require `mcp.auth.oauth2` or
`mcp.auth.service_account`, matching the configured authentication type.

```python
config = FabricConfig(
    metadata=MetadataConfig(name=job.name),
    harness=HarnessConfig(adapter_id=job.adapter_id, resolution="preinstalled"),
    models={
        "default": ModelConfig(
            provider=job.provider,
            model=job.model,
            api_key_env=job.api_key_env,
            base_url=job.base_url,
        )
    },
    instructions=(
        InstructionsConfig(
            system=InstructionConfig(content=job.system_instruction),
        )
        if job.system_instruction is not None
        else None
    ),
    runtime=RuntimeConfig(
        input_schema="chat",
        output_schema="message",
        timeout_seconds=job.timeout_seconds,
        max_turns=job.max_turns,
    ),
)
config.add_skill_path(job.skill_dir)
```

## Variants Without Files

Create deployment or evaluation variants with deep copies and plain functions.
Each copy resolves, plans, and runs independently.

```python
def with_relay(base: FabricConfig) -> FabricConfig:
    config = base.model_copy(deep=True)
    config.enable_relay(output_dir="./artifacts/relay")
    return config
```

Use this function-and-copy pattern for every variant; keep all variation in
ordinary Python.

For ATOF, author the NeMo Relay 0.7 schema-v3 file and stream sink model
directly. Put `RelayAtofFileSinkConfig` and `RelayAtofStreamSinkConfig`
instances in `RelayAtofConfig.sinks`, and set `RelayAtofConfig.enabled=True`.

## Relative Paths

If the config uses relative paths for skills, workspaces, or artifacts, pass
`base_dir=...` to `plan(...)`, `doctor(...)`, `run(...)`, or
`start_runtime(...)`. The base directory anchors those paths to the consumer's
package or job layout, so nothing depends on the process working directory.

## Adapter-Owned And Caller-Owned Data

- Use normalized fields for portable behavior: models, instructions, turn
  limit, runtime, environment, tools, skills, MCP, and telemetry.
- Supply request context through `RunRequest.context` for each invocation;
  request context is not part of `FabricConfig`.
- Use `harness.settings` for adapter-owned configuration declared by the
  selected descriptor. Each bundled adapter declares a closed settings schema.
  Executable paths, state directories, and Relay command discovery are runtime
  implementation details, not adapter settings. Adapter settings are not
  portable. Planning and `doctor(...)` validate them against the schema embedded
  in the exact resolved adapter descriptor; a descriptor without a schema
  accepts only an empty settings map.
- Use `workflow` to select a registered executable target. Set
  `workflow.target_id`; the Adapter Target Descriptor selects the adapter and
  supplies its entry point. `workflow.settings` contains only construction
  settings and is validated against that target's `spec.settings_schema`.
  Do not use workflow settings for caller-owned annotations.
  Omit `harness` for a target-driven run. If both selectors are set,
  `harness.adapter_id` must match the adapter selected by the target.
- Use `metadata` and extension fields outside `workflow` for caller-owned
  annotations NeMo Fabric carries but does not interpret. Config `metadata` is not echoed into
  `RunResult.metadata`: the name surfaces as `RunResult.agent_name`, and for
  caller-owned correlation on a specific invocation set `RunRequest.request_id`,
  which is returned as `RunResult.request_id`.

## Stays Hidden Behind The Boundary

Do not surface these mechanics in the consumer-facing integration:

- Replacing direct SDK calls with a private serialized transport
  (`to_mapping()` is for inspection and private process boundaries; redact
  credentials, headers, metadata, and other sensitive or user-provided fields
  before logging, and never emit an unredacted mapping to logs).
- Importing `nemo_fabric._native` or adapter-internal modules.
- Reimplementing harness start, invoke, or stop logic, or managing adapter
  threads, sessions, or processes.
