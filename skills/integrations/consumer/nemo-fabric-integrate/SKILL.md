# Integrate NeMo Fabric Through The Python SDK

Use this skill when a consumer codebase — an application, service, evaluation
harness, or platform — needs to run agent harnesses through NeMo Fabric's typed
Python SDK. The consumer owns its own configuration object and translates it
into an in-memory `FabricConfig`; NeMo Fabric owns adapter selection, the runtime
lifecycle, and normalized results.

Do not use this skill to author or modify NeMo Fabric adapters, change NeMo Fabric core or
its bindings, or maintain repository infrastructure. If you are contributing to
NeMo Fabric itself, use the maintainer skills in `.agents/skills/` instead.

## Integration Boundary

Stay on the public, in-memory contract. These rules keep a consumer integration
supported and upgrade-safe:

- Import only from the public `nemo_fabric` package. Never import `_native` or
  any adapter-internal module.
- Build configuration as a typed `FabricConfig` in memory and pass it directly to
  NeMo Fabric. Create every deployment or evaluation variant with ordinary Python
  functions and `model_copy(deep=True)`. A platform integration can serialize
  the typed config inside a private transient run specification when it crosses
  a process boundary; that transport is not a public authoring format.
- Let NeMo Fabric own harness control. Do not reimplement start, invoke, or stop
  logic, and do not manage adapter threads, sessions, or processes directly.
- Treat `runtime_id`, `invocation_id`, and `request_id` as opaque correlation
  strings, not parsable or reusable state.

See [config-mapping.md](references/config-mapping.md) for how to translate a
consumer config object into `FabricConfig`, and for the full list of mechanics
that stay hidden behind this boundary.

## Install And Set Up The Environment

The consumer or its execution environment owns installation; NeMo Fabric validates
runtime assumptions but never installs harnesses or credentials at run time.

- `uv pip install nemo-fabric[runtime]` (add the `harbor` extra for the Harbor integration). Refer to the
  [installation guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/blob/main/docs/getting-started/install.mdx).
- Select a harness adapter — the `adapter_id` set in `HarnessConfig`, for example
  `nvidia.fabric.hermes` — and install its extra the same way, for example
  `pip install "nemo-fabric[hermes]"`
  (available extras: `hermes`, `codex`, `deepagents`, `claude`), plus the
  corresponding harness binaries and dependencies.
- Provide model credentials through environment variables named by the config
  (`ModelConfig.api_key_env`), never as literals in code.
- Confirm the native extension is importable; SDK calls raise
  `FabricNativeUnavailableError` when it is missing.

## Build The Typed Config From Consumer Config

Map the consumer's application, job, or deployment object into a `FabricConfig`
with the public models and helper methods:

```python
from nemo_fabric import (
    FabricConfig,
    HarnessConfig,
    InstructionConfig,
    InstructionsConfig,
    MetadataConfig,
    ModelConfig,
    RuntimeConfig,
    ToolsConfig,
)


def to_tools_config(job) -> ToolsConfig | None:
    enabled = job.enabled_tools
    blocked = list(job.blocked_tools)
    if enabled is None and not blocked:
        return None
    return ToolsConfig(
        enabled=None if enabled is None else list(enabled),
        blocked=blocked,
    )


def to_fabric_config(job) -> FabricConfig:
    config = FabricConfig(
        metadata=MetadataConfig(name=job.name),
        harness=HarnessConfig(adapter_id=job.adapter_id, resolution="preinstalled"),
        models={
            "default": ModelConfig(
                provider=job.provider,
                model=job.model,
                api_key_env=job.api_key_env,
                base_url=job.base_url,
            )
        },
        instructions=(
            InstructionsConfig(
                system=InstructionConfig(content=job.system_instruction),
            )
            if job.system_instruction is not None
            else None
        ),
        runtime=RuntimeConfig(
            input_schema="chat",
            output_schema="message",
            timeout_seconds=job.timeout_seconds,
            max_turns=job.max_turns,
        ),
        tools=to_tools_config(job),
    )
    config.add_skill_path(job.skill_dir)
    config.add_mcp_server(
        "github",
        transport="streamable-http",
        url="${GITHUB_MCP_URL}",
        exposure="harness_native",
    )
    return config
```

- Shape capabilities with `ToolsConfig`, `block_tools`, `add_skill_path`,
  `remove_skill_path`,
  `add_mcp_server`, `remove_mcp_server`, and `enable_relay`.
- Create deployment or evaluation variants with `model_copy(deep=True)` and
  ordinary Python functions; each copy plans and runs independently.
- Pass `base_dir=...` to any `Fabric` call when the config uses relative paths,
  so skills, workspaces, and artifacts anchor to the consumer's own layout.

The repository [`code_review_agent` example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/tree/main/examples/code_review_agent)
shows this pattern end to end with complete Hermes Agent, Codex, Deep Agents,
environment, MCP, and telemetry variants. Reuse it rather than duplicating config
construction.

## Choose A Lifecycle

Pick the smallest lifecycle the consumer needs:

- **Single invocation** — one input, no retained state after the call.
  `await Fabric().run(config, input=...)` runs the full start, invoke, and stop
  cycle and returns a `RunResult`. Pass
  `request=RunRequest(...)` instead of `input=...` when the invocation needs a
  caller-owned request ID or context (the two are mutually exclusive).
- **Stateful runtime** — ordered turns over one logical harness lifecycle. Start it with
  `start_runtime(...)` and use the returned `Runtime` as an async context
  manager so cleanup runs on exit — shutdown is attempted, not guaranteed
  (`stop()` can raise `FabricRuntimeError`; see Consume Results And Handle
  Errors). A runtime accepts one active invocation at a time; overlapping calls
  raise `FabricStateError`.
- **NVIDIA NeMo Relay stream** — live, raw ATOF records plus a terminal normalized
  result. Enable NeMo Relay, pass `streaming=True` to `start_runtime(...)`, call
  `runtime.invoke_stream(...)`, iterate the returned `InvokeStream`, and then
  await `stream.result()`. Iteration ending does not indicate invocation
  success; invocation exceptions raise from `result()`, while harness-reported
  failures remain normalized `RunResult` values. If iteration stops early,
  call `await stream.aclose()` before starting another turn. `aclose()` waits
  for the turn to finish; it does not cancel the harness invocation. The SDK
  intentionally exposes only ATOF records generated by NeMo Relay. A future
  normalized NeMo Fabric contract will address adapter-native progressive
  output. The listener
  limits each record to 1 MiB and its queue to 1,024 records or 16 MiB of
  encoded data. It correlates records through the NeMo Fabric request ID for
  in-process harnesses. For gateway harnesses, it uses the NeMo Relay turn-scope
  role and 1-based turn index. It yields only the matched scope tree. Delayed
  prior-turn records therefore do not enter the next stream. If gateway and
  NeMo Fabric turn sequences do not align, the SDK discards the uncorrelated records
  and emits a `RuntimeWarning` after natural stream exhaustion. The listener
  binds to `NEMO_FABRIC_STREAMING_HOST`, which defaults to `127.0.0.1`.
  Override it when the gateway must reach the SDK through another network
  interface, and restrict access to that interface. If async iteration reaches
  its post-turn drain timeout without a NeMo Relay connection, or receives data
  without a matching turn root, the SDK emits one `RuntimeWarning` for that
  failure mode; callers that only await `stream.result()` do not run that
  warning check. The SDK also warns when a NeMo Relay upload terminates before
  completing its chunked request body because yielded records can be incomplete.
  The `streaming=True` flag does not enable NeMo Relay by itself. Without
  `streaming=True`, startup leaves the NeMo Relay configuration unchanged and
  does not inject the SDK-owned ATOF stream sink.

The selected adapter owns the execution topology. The bundled Claude, Codex,
Deep Agents, and Hermes Agent adapters retain their native client, graph/checkpointer,
or agent/database inside one local host for the full runtime. Local `process`
and `python` adapters use this host lifecycle; consumers do not select another
local execution mechanism in `FabricConfig`. Do not replay an invocation after
a runtime failure. Stop the failed runtime and explicitly start a new one
according to the application's retry policy.

The lifecycle fragment below shows both forms. It assumes the caller has already
set `config = to_fabric_config(job)` and chosen `base`, as described in the
configuration example above:

```python
import asyncio

from nemo_fabric import Fabric


async def main() -> None:
    fabric = Fabric()

    # Single invocation
    result = await fabric.run(config, base_dir=base, input="Review the changes.")

    # Multi-turn
    async with await fabric.start_runtime(config, base_dir=base) as runtime:
        first = await runtime.invoke(input="Inspect the repository")
        second = await runtime.invoke(input="Now review the latest patch")

    # NeMo Relay streaming
    streaming_config = config.model_copy(deep=True).enable_relay()
    async with await fabric.start_runtime(
        streaming_config,
        base_dir=base,
        streaming=True,
    ) as runtime:
        stream = runtime.invoke_stream(input="Review the latest patch")
        async for record in stream:
            print(record)
        streamed_result = await stream.result()


asyncio.run(main())
```

NeMo Fabric owns no application scheduling queue, worker pool, retry policy, or
global concurrency policy. Each runtime still permits only one active
invocation; start independent runtimes for parallel work. The NeMo Relay
streaming path uses an internal bounded transport queue and TCP backpressure
only to carry one invocation's ATOF records. Treat `stream.result()` as
authoritative, and reconstruct nested work from ATOF `uuid` and `parent_uuid`
fields rather than stream order.

## Validate Before Running

Resolve and diagnose before spending work on a runtime, especially in a new
environment or before relying on an optional capability:

```python
fabric = Fabric()
plan = fabric.plan(config, base_dir=base)             # sync: adapter + capabilities
report = await fabric.doctor(config, base_dir=base)   # async: preflight checks

print(plan.adapter.adapter_id, report.status)
```

- Use `plan(...)` to confirm adapter selection and capability routing before
  running.
- Use `doctor(...)` to check adapter availability, resolution, environment
  context, and declared requirements such as required environment variables. Its
  aggregate `status` is `pass`, `warn`, or `fail`. It does **not** validate the
  contents of `harness.settings`: an unknown or misspelled adapter setting still
  passes and is silently ignored unless the adapter reads it, so validate
  settings against the adapter's own docs and your integration tests.

## Consume Results And Handle Errors

Every invocation that reaches the adapter boundary returns a normalized
`RunResult`, even when the harness invocation itself failed. Inspect the failure
fields before reading output:

```python
result = await fabric.run(config, base_dir=base, input="Review the changes.")

if result.status == "succeeded":
    use_output(result.output, result.artifacts, result.telemetry)
else:
    handle_failure(result.status, result.error, result.events)  # failed, cancelled, ...
```

- Treat `status == "succeeded"` as the only success. Other terminal values
  (`failed`, `cancelled`) are unsuccessful, and `error` may be `None` even then,
  so branch on `status`, not on `error`. Read `status`, `error`, and `events`
  before processing `output`.
- Capture `artifacts` and `telemetry` references as the returned evidence for
  platforms and evaluations. Store and log `runtime_id`, `invocation_id`, and
  `request_id` separately as opaque strings.
- Catch `FabricError` subclasses for lifecycle failures that prevent a
  normalized result: `FabricConfigError`, `FabricCapabilityError`,
  `FabricRuntimeError`, `FabricStateError`, and `FabricNativeUnavailableError`.
- The consumer owns retries and failure policy; NeMo Fabric does not retry by
  default. `run(...)` and `async with` runtimes attempt cleanup automatically.
  When `run(...)` obtains a completed result before shutdown fails, it preserves
  the output in a failed result and records the stop error in `error` and
  `metadata.cleanup_errors`. Explicit `stop()`, including the automatic call
  when an `async with` block exits, can raise `FabricRuntimeError`. On a normal
  exit that error propagates; after an invocation error the cleanup failure is
  attached to the original exception.

See [results-and-errors.md](references/results-and-errors.md) for the full
result-field and error inventory, and
[sdk-api-inventory.md](references/sdk-api-inventory.md) for when to use each
`Fabric` and `Runtime` method.

## Test And Validate The Integration

- Write focused integration tests that build the consumer's `FabricConfig`,
  assert `plan(...)` selects the expected adapter and capabilities, and — where
  a harness and credentials are available — run one invocation and assert the
  `RunResult` status and evidence.
- `plan(...)` is credential-free — use it as the CI gate that validates adapter
  selection and capability routing without a model or secrets. `doctor(...)` also
  runs without calling a model, but it checks declared environment requirements
  (such as required API-key variables) and returns `fail` when they are unset, so
  run it where the environment is provisioned and read its per-check results.
- Run the consumer project's own build and test commands. For a source checkout
  of NeMo Fabric, `just build-all` rebuilds the native extension and
  `just test-python` runs the Python suite.
- Confirm the typed config is passed directly to NeMo Fabric and no non-public
  imports were added.

## Checklist

- [ ] The consumer config object is translated directly into an in-memory `FabricConfig`.
- [ ] Only public `nemo_fabric` symbols are imported; no `_native` or adapter internals.
- [ ] The consumer config is built in memory and passed directly to NeMo Fabric.
- [ ] The right lifecycle is chosen: `run(...)` for a single invocation, `start_runtime(...)` with `async with` for multi-turn, or `invoke_stream(...)` for raw NeMo Relay ATOF.
- [ ] `plan(...)` and `doctor(...)` validate adapter selection, capabilities, and environment before execution.
- [ ] Installation, adapter dependencies, and credentials are owned by the environment, not consumer code.
- [ ] `RunResult` status, error, and events are inspected before output; artifacts and telemetry are captured.
- [ ] `FabricError` subclasses and failed `RunResult` cleanup errors are handled; cleanup is delegated to `run(...)` or `async with`.
- [ ] Correlation IDs are stored and logged as opaque strings.
- [ ] Focused integration tests pass and NeMo Fabric validation (`plan`/`doctor`, tests) succeeds.
