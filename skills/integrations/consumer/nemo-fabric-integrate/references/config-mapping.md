# Mapping Consumer Config To FabricConfig

Translate the consumer's own application, job, or deployment object into a typed
`FabricConfig` in memory. The consumer keeps owning its configuration model;
NeMo Fabric only receives the validated slice it needs.

## Public Config Models

Import these from the top-level `nemo_fabric` package:

| Model | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `FabricConfig` | Root config passed to every `Fabric` call. |
| `MetadataConfig` | Agent name and description. |
| `HarnessConfig` | `adapter_id`, `resolution`, and adapter-owned `settings`. |
| `ModelConfig` | Provider, model, credentials (`api_key_env`), endpoint, and sampling. |
| `InstructionsConfig` / `InstructionConfig` | Portable agent instructions and replacement mode. |
| `RuntimeConfig` | Input/output labels, artifact location, invocation timeout, and harness turn limit. |
| `EnvironmentConfig` | Execution environment, workspace, and harness-visible variables. |
| `ToolsConfig` | Adapter-native tool selection and blocking policy. |
| `McpConfig` / `McpServerConfig` | MCP servers and exposure. |
| `SkillConfig` | Skill directories. |
| `TelemetryConfig` | Telemetry providers. |
| `RelayConfig` and `Relay*Config` | NVIDIA NeMo Relay observability under the top-level `relay` block. |

The [models reference](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/blob/main/docs/reference/api/python-library-reference/nemo_fabric.models.md)
indexes the public config models. The generated pages omit constructor fields and
defaults, so read the installed `nemo_fabric` models (they ship `py.typed`) for
exact field names and defaults.

For Claude and Codex, provider identifiers outside the adapter-native set
require both `ModelConfig.base_url` and `ModelConfig.api_key_env`. Planning
validates those fields before adapter startup.

## Build And Shape

Construct the nested config directly, then adjust capabilities with helper
methods that edit the typed config in place and return it:

- `add_skill_path(path)` / `remove_skill_path(path)`
- `add_mcp_server(name, *, transport, url, exposure, ...)` / `remove_mcp_server(name)`
- `enable_relay(...)` for NVIDIA NeMo Relay observability in the `relay` block
- `ToolsConfig(enabled=..., blocked=...)` for tool policy
- `block_tools(...)` for additive deny policy

```python
config = FabricConfig(
    metadata=MetadataConfig(name=job.name),
    harness=HarnessConfig(adapter_id=job.adapter_id, resolution="preinstalled"),
    models={"default": ModelConfig(provider=job.provider, model=job.model, api_key_env=job.api_key_env, base_url=job.base_url)},
    instructions=(
        InstructionsConfig(
            system=InstructionConfig(content=job.system_instruction),
        )
        if job.system_instruction is not None
        else None
    ),
    runtime=RuntimeConfig(
        input_schema="chat",
        output_schema="message",
        timeout_seconds=job.timeout_seconds,
        max_turns=job.max_turns,
    ),
)
config.add_skill_path(job.skill_dir)
```

## Variants Without Files

Create deployment or evaluation variants with deep copies and plain functions.
Each copy resolves, plans, and runs independently.

```python
def with_relay(base: FabricConfig) -> FabricConfig:
    config = base.model_copy(deep=True)
    config.enable_relay(output_dir="./artifacts/relay")
    return config
```

Use this function-and-copy pattern for every variant; keep all variation in
ordinary Python.

For ATOF, author the NeMo Relay 0.6 sink model directly. Put
`RelayAtofFileSinkConfig` and `RelayAtofStreamSinkConfig` instances in
`RelayAtofConfig.sinks`, and set `RelayAtofConfig.enabled=True`.

## Relative Paths

If the config uses relative paths for skills, workspaces, or artifacts, pass
`base_dir=...` to `plan(...)`, `doctor(...)`, `run(...)`, or
`start_runtime(...)`. The base directory anchors those paths to the consumer's
package or job layout, so nothing depends on the process working directory.

## Adapter-Owned And Caller-Owned Data

- Use normalized fields for portable behavior: models, instructions, turn
  limit, runtime, environment, tools, skills, MCP, and telemetry.
- Supply request context through `RunRequest.context` for each invocation;
  request context is not part of `FabricConfig`.
- Use `harness.settings` for adapter-owned configuration the selected adapter
  understands (for example Claude permission policy, Codex sandbox controls, or
  Deep Agents subagent definitions). Executable paths, state directories, and
  Relay command discovery are runtime implementation details, not adapter
  settings. Adapter settings are not portable, and `doctor(...)` does not yet
  validate their contents. Validate them against the adapter's docs and your
  integration tests.
- Use `metadata` and extension fields for caller-owned annotations NeMo Fabric carries
  but does not interpret. Config `metadata` is not echoed into
  `RunResult.metadata`: the name surfaces as `RunResult.agent_name`, and for
  caller-owned correlation on a specific invocation set `RunRequest.request_id`,
  which is returned as `RunResult.request_id`.

## Stays Hidden Behind The Boundary

Do not surface these mechanics in the consumer-facing integration:

- Replacing direct SDK calls with a private serialized transport
  (`to_mapping()` is for inspection and private process boundaries; redact
  credentials, headers, metadata, and other sensitive or user-provided fields
  before logging, and never emit an unredacted mapping to logs).
- Importing `nemo_fabric._native` or adapter-internal modules.
- Reimplementing harness start, invoke, or stop logic, or managing adapter
  threads, sessions, or processes.
